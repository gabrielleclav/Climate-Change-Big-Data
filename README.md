# Climate-Change-Big-Data
Big Data project with Climate Change features 
The code being put in here will be cleaning/profiling code for my project using MapReduce program. It was supposed to filter out year 1991 until the most recent year in the dataset from WorldBank (population data for all countries and this was done in the mapper class of my file). So it ignored all the years before 1991. Even though it was not later on used, these code helped with other cleaning for the other datasets that we used in the end.
